# Nano Sessions

The Nano Sessions connect the people who are interested in nanopublications and who want to learn from each other about the related technologies. Every session consists of two 10-minute talks, discussion, and a news sharing part. See the [description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-0aImR4bFHmay8j6bSFgIDi9sw01KXdmYw9szyhAWmY/edit#) for more information.


[Knowledge Pixels](https://knowledgepixels.com/) hosts the first meetings, but we are happy to let others join and become hosts too. Do you want to share some insights, a problem you canâ€™t solve, or a use case you are working on? Send an [email](mailto:ph.vonessen@bluewin.ch) to get a slot in an upcoming session.
