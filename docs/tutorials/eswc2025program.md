## Module 1

Module 1 is the first morning session.

### What are nanopublications?

:::info speaker: Tobias Kuhn | 9:00-9:30
:::

- Introduction to the concept and technology of [nanopublications](https://nanopub.net/) with [examples](https://nanopub.net/docs/examples)
- The long-term vision of a nanopublication ecosystem
- Technical architecture overview
- Introduction to [Nanodash](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/)
- Nanopublication network: [the servers forming the nanopublication ecosystem](https://monitor.knowledgepixels.com/)

### Individual projects, part 1

:::info 9:30-9:45
:::

- Participants set up their [nanopublication profile](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/profile) and come up with a small project for the day

### Creating and publishing nanopublications

:::info speakers: Tobias Kuhn, Vincent Emonet, Barbara Magagna | 9:45-10:30
:::

- Programmatic creation via libraries and command-line tools: [nanopub-java](https://github.com/Nanopublication/nanopub-java), [nanopub-py](https://github.com/Nanopublication/nanopub-py), [nanopub-rs](https://github.com/vemonet/nanopub-rs)
- Creating nanopublications in other environments: [Data Stewardship Wizard](https://ds-wizard.org/)


## Module 2

Module 2 is the second morning session.

### Nanopublication templates

:::info speaker: Tobias Kuhn | 11:00-11:30
:::

- Connecting to external APIs for look-up
- Provenance and publication info templates

### Individual projects, part 2

:::info 11:30-12:00
:::

- Participants continue on their own small project.

### Querying nanopublications

:::info speaker: Tobias Kuhn | 12:00-12:30
:::

- [Nanopub Query](https://github.com/knowledgepixels/nanopub-query): how nanopublications are loaded into triple stores on the network
- Querying nanopublications with SPARQL queries via Nanopub Query
- Create specific APIs with nanopublications and grlc


## Module 3

Module 3 is the first afternoon session.

### Applications, part 1
