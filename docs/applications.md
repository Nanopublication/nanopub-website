This is an incomplete list of nanopublication applications:

- **[Knowledge Collaboratory](https://collaboratory.semanticscience.org)**: a service to help annotate biomedical claims, publish the annotations as nanopublications, and browse nanopublications.

- **[Data Stewardship Wizard](https://ds-wizard.org/)**: publish [FAIR implementation profiles](https://www.go-fair.org/how-to-go-fair/fair-implementation-profile/) as nanopublications?

- **[RiverBench](https://w3id.org/riverbench)**: benchmark suite for RDF systems, which uses nanopublications to allow users to [publish their benchmark results](https://w3id.org/riverbench/v/dev/results).

- **[RDF Stream Taxonomy (RDF-STaX)](https://w3id.org/stax/dev/nanopubs)**: uses nanopublications to make a *living literature review* of RDF streaming.

* [**fairworkflows**](https://github.com/fair-workflows/fairworkflows): a python library for constructing, modifying and publishing scientific workflows described using semantic technologies.
