Nanopublications are published in a **decentralized network of services** with separated publishing/retrieval and querying layers.

## 🌐 Nanopub Monitor

The **Nanopub Monitor** ([instance](http://purl.org/nanopub/monitor), [code](https://github.com/tkuhn/nanopub-monitor/)) is a service to observe all services in the nanopublication network.

## 🗄️ Nanopub Server/Registry

There are currently two generations of services for publishing and retrieving nanopublications in a decentralized fashion.

The **Nanopub Server** ([instance](https://np.knowledgepixels.com/), [code](https://github.com/tkuhn/nanopub-server)) forms the _first-generation_ publishing/retrieval service.

We will soon transition to the _second-generation_ publishing/retrieval services in the form of the **Nanopub Registry** ([instance](https://registry.knowledgepixels.com/), [code](https://github.com/knowledgepixels/nanopub-registry)).

## 💫 Nanopub Query

**Nanopub Query** ([instance](https://query.knowledgepixels.com/), [code](https://github.com/knowledgepixels/nanopub-query)) forms the second-generation of services to query nanopublications. They allow for decentrally querying the published nanopublications via a number of SPARQL endpoint covering different subsets and aspects of nanopublications.
