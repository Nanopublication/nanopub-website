Nanopublications are published in a **decentralized network of services** with separated publishing/retrieval and querying layers.

## 🌐 Nanopub Monitor

The **Nanopub Monitor** ([instance](http://purl.org/nanopub/monitor), [code](https://github.com/tkuhn/nanopub-monitor/)) is a service to observe all services in the nanopublication network.

## 🗄️ Nanopub Registry

**Nanopub Registry** is the second-generation kind of service for publishing and retrieving nanopublications in a decentralized fashion: ([instance](https://registry.knowledgepixels.com/), [code](https://github.com/knowledgepixels/nanopub-registry)).

## 💫 Nanopub Query

**Nanopub Query** ([instance](https://query.knowledgepixels.com/), [code](https://github.com/knowledgepixels/nanopub-query)) forms the second-generation of services to query nanopublications. They allow for decentrally querying the published nanopublications via a number of SPARQL endpoint covering different subsets and aspects of nanopublications.
